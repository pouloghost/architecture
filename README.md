# architecture
This is a small android demo showing my understand of app architecture. This architecture is a creation after reading about MVP, flux, redux, clean-architecture and google's android-architecture. 
This is mainly about decoping everything, the overall idea is to break all components into the finest grain, when put into production, combine some components to make it less complicate. Hopefully, this should be able to fit into any real life app, and make things a little bit more elegant.
All components are shown in above picture, and each connection between component is likely a cut-in for decoping methods such as IOC, KVO.
